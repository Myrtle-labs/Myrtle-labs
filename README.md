# Background:

Myrtle labs was conceived after the ETHGlobal hackathon with the aim of leveraging the value of digital assets beyond the metaverse and digital world by applying it in real world use cases.

### Use Case:

- **Gaming assets:** Players can lease out their assets to other players in the gaming platfrom without having to buy those assets.

- **Event tickets:** For event tickets that has utility, it can be rented out in the event you do not want to attend an event or can't attend an event while you keep your utility benefit

- **Virtual land:** You can rent a portion of land in the metaverse for your upcoming activities in cases where your land isn't enough to accomodate guests.

- **Subscriptions:** This use case is in form of rental pools where an automatic digital subscription for services like nutrition planning updates are sent to the subscriber for monthly fee.

- **Music:** Due to the high barrier of entry, creatives in this field can leverage the rental space to rent out their songs, soundtracks for others and fans to enjoy.
